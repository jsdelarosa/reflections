When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share the code I'm working on, or when I wanna make a collaboration.
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you can have control about if itâ€™s worth the situation or not to pull or push a file.
